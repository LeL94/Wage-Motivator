    Welcome to <b>Wage Motivator</b>! If you are using this app you probably are in a difficult
    moment at work... Well, believe me, you are not alone. What if I told you, instead, that
    millions of people around the world are frustrated with their work.

    <br><br>But it has not to be this way!

    <br><br>I was developed as a nice tool to remember you that, no matter what, you are still being
    paid for your work (hope so).
    <br>If you did not already go, just go to the <i>Settings</i> and put your
    daily wage and your working hours, and I will remember you how long it remains to finish your
    working day, and how much you have earned till now, in real time.

    <br><br>What else to say? Enjoy! And remember, please <b>DO NOT touch MY progress bar</b>.
