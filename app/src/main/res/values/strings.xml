        Welcome to Wage Motivator! If you are using this app you probably are in a difficult
        moment at work... Well, believe me, you are not alone. What if I told you, instead, that
        millions of people around the world are frustrated with their work.

        <br><br>But it has not to be this way!

        <br><br>I was developed as a nice tool to remember you that, no matter what, you are still being
        paid for your work (hope so). If you did not already go, just go to the Settings and put your
        daily wage and your working hours, and I will remember you how long it remains to finish your
        working day, and how much you have earned till now, in real time.

        <br><br>What else to say? Enjoy! And remember, please DO NOT touch MY progress bar.
