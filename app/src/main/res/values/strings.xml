        Welcome to Wage Motivator! If you are using this app you probably are in a difficult
        moment at work... Well, believe me, you are not <b>alone</b>. What if I told you, instead, that
        millions of people around the world are <b>frustrated</b> with their <b>work</b>.

        <br><br>But it has not to be this way!

        <br><br>I was developed as a <b>nice tool</b> to remember you that, no matter what, you are still <b>being
        paid</b> for your <b>work</b> (hope so). If you didnt already go, just go to the <i>Settings</i> and put your
        <b>daily wage</b> (you know it, dont ya) and your <b>working hours</b>, and I will remember you how long it remains to finish your
        working day, and how much you have earned today, in <b>real time</b>.

        <br><br>What else to say? Enjoy! And remember, please <b>DO NOT touch MY progress bar</b>.
